# SVG Accessible Chart

## Data Visualization of International Students in the United States
SVG, ARIA and HTML5 elements are used to make a data chart accessible for people with blindness or low-vision. The data chart is on "Top 10 places of origin of international students in the united states". The chart is accessible as it can be read by popular screen readers including NVDA. The data is part of IIE (Institute of International Education) report released during 2019.
